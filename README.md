# Econometrics II

1. Course Overview

Econometrics II is an advanced applied course focused on multivariate data analysis, exploratory techniques, and modern analytical methods used in economics and business contexts. The course emphasizes understanding complex datasets, extracting meaningful patterns, and communicating results effectively through statistical reasoning and visualization.

Building on prior statistical and econometric foundations, this course introduces students to multivariate methods, text analysis, network analysis, and applied data analysis using statistical software. The focus is both conceptual and practical, bridging theory with real-world economic applications.

4. Tools and Technologies

Throughout the course, students work with modern analytical tools, including:
	•	Statistical computing using R and RStudio.
	•	Data manipulation, transformation, and visualization.
	•	R Markdown for reproducible analysis and reporting.
	•	Applied use of data visualization libraries for multivariate analysis.

The emphasis is on practical use of software as a core analytical skill rather than purely theoretical exposition.

5. Methodology and Learning Approach

The course follows a flipped classroom methodology, where:
	•	Conceptual learning and readings are completed outside the classroom.
	•	Class time is dedicated to applied exercises, case studies, discussion, and problem-solving.
	•	Students actively engage in collaborative analysis and interpretation of real-world datasets.

This approach encourages deeper understanding, critical thinking, and hands-on experience with econometric methods.

6. Projects and Evaluation

Student learning is reinforced through:
	•	Case studies focused on economic and business scenarios.
	•	Guided analytical exercises using statistical software.
	•	A final research project integrating multiple econometric techniques.
	•	Emphasis on interpretation, visualization, and communication of results.

The final project consolidates methodological knowledge and practical skills into a comprehensive applied analysis.

7. Purpose of This Repository

This repository serves as a structured reference and learning companion for the course. It is designed to:
	•	Organize course materials, presentations, and exercises.
	•	Support hands-on practice with econometric methods.
	•	Provide a reusable resource for applied multivariate analysis.
	•	Showcase applied econometrics skills relevant to professional and academic settings.

The repository is intended for students, analysts, and professionals interested in advanced econometric and multivariate data analysis.
